# NuclearTech
NuclearTech is very simple c++ engine that use vulkan backend
it is firstly designed for personal use, because of that for example i didnt put any image loader, only very simple obj parser.
This engine uses my own vulkan interpretation, MagmaVK.
An very simple, but useful in my opinion is my colision system, it calculate colision for each vertex, because of that it work without any setup.
i also provided an simple example, if you really want to use it(i do not recomend ðŸ˜…).  
don't forget to compile shaders!
