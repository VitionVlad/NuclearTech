# NuclearTech
NuclearTech is very simple c++ engine that use vulkan backend
it does not have any audio engine (in my projects i am using alut, that is standalone).  
what is more important is that i have simple props with physics and colision, simple animations, support of files with vertex color, and for textures.  
i also have put some shaders, but they are made as a base, especialy for this i put a special variable, this variable is 4 component of vertexpos, you can use how you want, i personaly use it to switch textures betweet models.  ![Снимок экрана от 2022-07-23 22-42-47](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48290199/180620580-ede5f8e5-05ce-4cfc-8cd1-1bb596058704.png)
